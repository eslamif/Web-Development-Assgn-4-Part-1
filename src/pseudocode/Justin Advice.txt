I would probably start with the loopback. That is a single function that is basically just getting variables from the request and printing them.

From there there multiplication table and the session portion are both multiple step processes. For the mutliplication table, I would make a static HTML table, then figure out how to dynamically make that exact table in PHP, then figure out how to dynamically change it based on the input.

For the login/session portion I am not quite sure what guidance to give, there are several pieces that need to work together. The only thing to really isolate is the login portion.
